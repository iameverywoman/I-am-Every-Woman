                We deconstructed many layers from the ThugBirdz collection and
                subsequently reconstructed a collection, ensuring each xThugBird
                is uniquely different from the Birdz in the ThugBirdz
                collection.

                The team has chosen just a single color for the background; a
                stunning shade of yellow. This background color offers an
                obvious distinction from those in the ThugBirdz collection.

              <p>
                Expansion ThugBirdz look out for one another, and family is
                everything to these warm-blooded vertebrates. In order to ensure
                their loved ones are taken care of, each transaction related to
                the buying and selling of xThugBirdz will incur a 7% creator
                royalty that ultimately goes back to the community. The proceeds
                generated will facilitate two things:

                    80% of the proceeds will be used to acquire Expansion
                    ThugBirdz will be locked in the XTB Vault forever (unless
                    voted upon by the community to release them in an agreed
                    manner I.e. giveaways etc).

                    20% of the proceeds will be used to maintain the Expansion
                    ThugBirdz ecosystem i.e. community moderators, social media
                    manager, development, etc.
